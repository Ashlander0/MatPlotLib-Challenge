# MatPlotLib-Challenge

Observations

1. The testing seems to have been well planned out, with each drug having close to the same number of mice tested, and roughly the same amount of time, as well as a near 50/50 distribution of males and females.

2. There is a strong correlation between weight and the size of the tumor. 

3. Capomulin and Ramicane seem to be the most effective, having a much lower average tumor volume by the end of treatment than all the others, even the other two 'top' drugs tested.
